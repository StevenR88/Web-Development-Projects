### Project Description
Online 2D territorial pixel game based on the Reddit experiment /r/place.
There is a 2D map with N x M grid with each quadrant filled with one of four colors.
Everytime a new player joins the game, they will be prompted to join one of the four
colors.
Each player is allowed to press on a pixel to change its color to the clicker's team. A
user is only allowed to click on a pixel that is adjacent to an already existing pixel with
the same user color.
The goal of the game is to completely eradicate your opponents and each user will
have a delay of X seconds before theyâ€™re allowed to press on a new pixel. This will
encourage you to be strategic in your moves instead of spamming one button as fast
as you can.
When one color manages to conquer an entire map, the score will be updated and
the map will revert back to the default map.
